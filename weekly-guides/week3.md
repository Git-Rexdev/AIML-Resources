# Code Crackers Club – AI/ML Week 3

Welcome to **Week 3** of the **AI/ML Learning Series** by Code Crackers.
This week focuses on understanding fundamental **Machine Learning algorithms**—Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and an introduction to some **commonly used ML models**. These concepts form the foundation of predictive analytics and supervised learning.

## Week 3 Learning Resources

### 1. Linear Regression

Learn how Linear Regression works to predict continuous numerical outcomes based on independent variables.
Understand the mathematics behind the regression line, cost function, and gradient descent.

**Practice Notebook:**
[Hands-on Linear Regression with Python (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/taweilo/linear-regression-example)

### 2. Logistic Regression

Explore Logistic Regression, a classification algorithm that predicts categorical outcomes such as True/False or Yes/No.
Understand the concept of the sigmoid function, decision boundaries, and how probabilities are mapped.

### 3. Common Machine Learning Algorithms

Get an overview of popular algorithms used in ML applications.

#### Supervised Learning

- **Decision Trees** – Tree-based classification and regression.
- **Random Forests** – Ensemble method for better accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** – Effective for high-dimensional spaces.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Simple, instance-based learning algorithm.

#### Unsupervised Learning

- **K-Means Clustering** – Grouping data based on similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Dimensionality reduction technique.

#### Reinforcement Learning

- Learn the basics of how agents learn through rewards and actions in an environment.

## Task for Week 3

Create a Jupyter Notebook implementing both **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using `scikit-learn`.
Use any dataset of your choice (for example, the **Iris** or **Salary Prediction** dataset).

### Notebook Requirements

1. Import and preprocess your dataset.
2. Implement Linear Regression and visualize predictions.
3. Implement Logistic Regression for classification.
4. Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, MSE, or R².
5. Add clear comments and markdown explanations.

---

## Repository Update

1. Add a new file named `Week3.md` to your GitHub repository (`YourName-CC-AIML-W25`).
2. Summarize the concepts you learned:
   - Key takeaways from Linear and Logistic Regression.
   - Short notes on different ML algorithms.
   - Insights or errors you encountered while implementing models.

---

## Weekly Action Plan

- [ ] Watch and study all listed resources.
- [ ] Complete both model implementations.
- [ ] Update your repository with code and documentation.
- [ ] Discuss learnings and doubts with peers or mentors.
