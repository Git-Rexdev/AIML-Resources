# Code Crackers Club – AI/ML Week 4

Welcome to **Week 4** of the **AI/ML Learning Series** by Code Crackers.
This week focuses on understanding how to build backend APIs using **FastAPI** and integrate them with a **MongoDB** database.
By the end of this week, you’ll be able to perform CRUD operations and understand how backends interact with databases in ML or data-driven applications.

## Week 4 Learning Resources

### 1. Introduction to FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs quickly with Python.
It supports asynchronous programming, automatic documentation, and data validation using Pydantic.

### 2. Introduction to MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
It’s ideal for applications requiring scalability and fast development.

## Week 4 Practical Notebook

Open the provided notebook [`week4.ipynb`](./week4.ipynb) to explore:

- Setting up FastAPI
- Connecting to MongoDB
- Creating and using data models with Pydantic
- Implementing CRUD routes
- Running and testing API endpoints with Uvicorn

---

## Task for Week 4

1. Open and run the `week4.ipynb` notebook.
2. Modify the code to use your own MongoDB database or URI (local or cloud-based).
3. Add at least 5 student records and try all CRUD operations using FastAPI routes.
4. Document your learnings in this week’s section of your GitHub repository.

---

## Repository Update

1. Add both `week4.ipynb` and `week4.md` files to your GitHub repository (`YourName-CC-AIML-W25`).
2. Write a short summary covering:
   - What you learned about FastAPI and MongoDB.
   - How backend and database connect.
   - Any challenges faced or errors solved.

---

## Weekly Action Plan

- [ ] Watch all tutorial videos.
- [ ] Run and explore the provided notebook.
- [ ] Experiment with different datasets or collections.
- [ ] Update your GitHub repo with this week’s progress.
